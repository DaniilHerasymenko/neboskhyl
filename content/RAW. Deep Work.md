Blow defines "deep work" as something which:

1. Changes you. You are different at the end, your skills and/or insights have advanced.
    
2. Takes you to an unknown destination, but has a guiding compass internal to _you_.
    
3. Turns you into a unique specialist. You’ve gone more deeply into specific areas than most in your field.
    
4. Is something most people aren’t doing because they don’t think they can.
    
5. Can be done from first principles. You don’t always need funding or a special environment to do deep work.
